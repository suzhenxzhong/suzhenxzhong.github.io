## About Me

I am **Suzhen Zhong**, a Ph.D. candidate in the [Software Evolution & Analytics Lab (SEAL)](https://seal.queensu.ca/) at **Queen’s University**, Canada.  
My research lies at the intersection of **Software Engineering** and **Artificial Intelligence**, focusing on how developers collaborate with large language models (LLMs) such as GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and Claude.

## Research Focus

My work explores **developer–LLM conversations** and the impact of AI teammates on modern software development.  
I study how AI assistance affects **code quality**, **workflow efficiency**, and **knowledge gaps**, contributing toward a vision of *Software Engineering 3.0* — where people, AI, processes, and technology co-evolve.

## Datasets & Tools

- 📦 **[CodeChat](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Suzhen/CodeChatRaw)** — 82K multi-turn developer–LLM conversations and 368K code snippets, mined from open-source repositories.  
- 📊 **AIDev Dataset** — 456K pull requests across 61K repos, categorized by AI involvement (agent-post, human-post, human-pre), with reviewer logs and churn metrics.  
- ⚙️ Open-source tools for GitHub mining, PR classification, BERTopic clustering, and conversation analysis.

## Selected Publications

- **Developer–LLM Conversations: An Empirical Study of Interactions and Generated Code Quality**  
  _Preprint: [arXiv:2509.10402](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10402) — submitted to IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE)_
