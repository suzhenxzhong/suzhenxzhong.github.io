## About Me

I am **Suzhen Zhong**, a Ph.D. candidate in the [Software Evolution & Analytics Lab (SEAL)](https://seal.queensu.ca/) at **Queen’s University**, Canada, co-supervised by [Prof. Ying Zou](https://www.ece.queensu.ca/people/Ying-Zou.html) and [Prof. Bram Adams](https://mcis.cs.queensu.ca/bram.html). My research lies at the intersection of **Software Engineering** and **Artificial Intelligence**, with a focus on **developer–LLM collaboration, automated code review, and the socio-technical impact of AI teammates**.

## Research Vision

I explore how large language models (LLMs) such as GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and Claude are reshaping modern software development workflows. My current work examines **multi-turn developer–LLM interactions**, measuring **code quality**, **knowledge gaps**, and **workflow efficiency**. This work contributes toward a new generation of *Human-Centered AI* tooling and methods for **Software Engineering 3.0**, where people, AI, process, and technology co-evolve.

## Datasets and Tools

- 📦 **[CodeChat](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Suzhen/CodeChatRaw)** — 82K multi-turn developer–LLM conversations and 368K code snippets, mined from open-source repositories using GPT-4 and custom pipelines.  
- 📊 **AIDev Dataset** (coming soon) — 456K pull requests across 61K repos, categorized by AI involvement (agent-post, human-post, human-pre), with reviewer logs, merge stats, and churn metrics.  
- ⚙️ Mining and analysis tools in Python & R for GitHub API, BERTopic clustering, PR classification, and topic-shift tracking.
